Welcome to the Movie Trailers App! This React.js project, created using Vite, allows you to explore and watch trailers for various movies. The app displays movie posters, and upon clicking a poster, you can watch the trailer along with detailed information about the movie. Additionally, you can filter movies based on language and genre, and you have the flexibility to combine both filters for a more refined search.
